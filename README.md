# Viatech

Viatech is a web applacation catered specifically to Biotech companies. The FDA requires Biotech companies to keep proper documentation of all  procedures/assays run in the lab. These procedures contain reagents that have a Certificate of Analysis, which provides a description of the reagent, proper storage conditions and expiration dates.
Clients expect documents to be properly QCed, but in most cases there is a lack of education and organization in this department. 
What our app aims to accomplish is an efficient way to organize documents and keep track of the processeses in order to maintain the Quality Control in each process leading to the verified end product.
